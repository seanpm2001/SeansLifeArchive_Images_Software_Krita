// About:
// I decided to make C++ the first project language file for this project (seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_Software_Krita) as C++ is the main language that the Krita graphic design software is written in. This project is about the Krita graphic design software, so it makes sense to use C++ to represent this. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
